**Project : Academic Doubts**

**Objective:**
Create an automated system for students to submit academic doubts and receive responses through email using the Gemini API.

**Components:**

1. **Data Submission:**
   - **Frontend:** Develop a React form to collect up to 5 academic doubts from students.
   - **Backend Integration:** Collect the form responses in a Google Sheet.

2. **API Integration:**
   - **Gemini API:** Use the API to analyze and respond to the submitted doubts. It should either provide answers or generate progress reports based on mentors' feedback.
   - **Google Sheets Update:** Store the API responses or generated reports in the Google Sheet.

3. **Forwarding Answers via Email:**
   - **Email Integration:** Automatically send the generated answers or reports to the student's email address provided in the form.

**React Form Code Overview:**

- **State Management:** Handles form data and loading state with `useState`.
- **Form Validation:** Uses a `validate` function to ensure data integrity before submission.
- **API Interaction:** Submits form data to a specified URL using `axios`, and handles responses with notifications (`toast`).
- **Form Structure:** Includes fields for personal information (name, gender, phone number, email) and up to 5 doubts. Provides real-time validation feedback.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Form Fields:** 
   - Personal information: First name, Last name, Gender, Mobile, Email
   - Doubts: Up to 5 text areas for student doubts.

2. **Submission Handling:**
   - Uses `axios` to post form data to a Google Apps Script URL.
   - Handles errors and success notifications.

3. **UI Components:**
   - Includes form elements for input and validation errors.
   - Displays submission status with loading indicators.
